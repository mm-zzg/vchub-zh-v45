# Schedule

The schedule is a tool used in the system to manage and schedule script execution. The schedule allows you to view the last execution time and execution result of multiple scripts. In the schedule list, the execution time and execution result of the most recent script are displayed on the right page. Users can manipulate the schedule by using the Add, Modify, and Delete buttons, and edit the specific information of the schedule in the Add and Modify windows. In addition, users can view logs and schedules, and the View Schedules page gives them the option to view all the schedules created in the system and display their activity schedules on the calendar control.
