# Alarm Notification

This feature aims to enhance the response efficiency of safety management. When an alarm is triggered by the on-site environment, the system will automatically generate an alert and promptly notify the responsible personnel via email or SMS. By delivering accurate alarm information, it ensures that relevant personnel can quickly grasp the on-site situation and make timely decisions to reduce potential risks and losses.

## Seven Steps to Alarm Notification

#### User 

Setting up contact information for users is the first step in sending alarm notifications. You can add contact information for users when creating them.

#### User Groups

The second step in sending alarm notifications is to create user groups. When an alarm is triggered, the notification will be sent to the designated user group, and the users within that group will receive the alarm notification information.

#### Alarm Notification Service

The notification service is the third step in sending alarm notifications, used to configure the types of notifications (email, SMS) and their corresponding services.

#### Alarm Notification Message

The notification content is the fourth step in sending alarm notifications, used to set the content of the email or SMS that will be sent.

#### Alarm Notification Schedule

The notification scheduling is the fifth step in sending alarm notifications, used to set the time periods during which users will receive alarm notifications.

#### Alarm Notification Rules

The notification rule is the sixth step in sending alarm notifications, used to set the conditions for sending alarms, selecting the notification service, recipients, and scheduling.

#### Add Alarm Rule To A Tag

The last step of the alarm notification is to select the notification rule for each alarm of the tag. When an alarm occurs for the tag, the alarm content will be generated according to this notification rule.
